How to Screen :- 1- press "Fn" + (insert {prt sc} ) --> Screen Shot 2- by using app : "prnt scrn" https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-print-screen-pc https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-screenshot-on-windows Older versions of Windows Just
like with newer versions of Windows, you will want to load the page that you want to take an image of before proceeding. From there, do the following: Press the PrtSc button, which is typically located in the upper-right-hand side of your keyboard
by the “Function” keys. If your laptop has a “Fn” key, you may need to simultaneously press the “Fn” key and the “PrtSc” key. Open MS Paint from the Start menu. Do this by typing “paint” and navigating to the program in the search results. Paste
the screenshot into MS Paint by pressing Ctrl+V at the same time. The image will appear in MS Paint, and you’ll need to save it to your computer’s hard drive. Save the image by pressing Ctrl+S, which will bring up a window where you can designate
where to store it. You can also choose the screenshot’s file type, JPEG or PNG. For screenshots, PNG is the better option because it maintains the quality of the image in a smaller file size. Using Windows 10’s snipping tool If you use Windows
10 and want to make a screenshot, you should be familiar with the Snipping Tool. It can help you get the perfect image and allows you to crop your screenshots. To access it: From the Start menu, choose All Programs Choose Accessories, which is
where the Snipping Tool is located In Windows 10,

you can also press the Start key on your keyboard and type “snipping tool” into the search bar. Your screenshot will automatically choose the “Rectangular Snip” as the default option, but you can
choose from a number of different options to find the shape you want. Using Windows 10 Snip & Sketch In October 2018, Windows added another way for you to take and access screenshots: Load the Snip & Sketch program on your device from the Start
menu. Select the New button from the upper left-hand corner. Once the window is no longer on your screen, you can choose which type of screenshot you want. You have the option of free-form, full-screen, or a rectangular image. Another way to capture
the screenshot is by clicking the down arrow next to New. This also delays the snip for a few seconds. Your image will be stored in the Snip & Sketch program, where you can add annotations or use the pencil or pen tool to draw on it. It is also
accessible on your clipboard with any changes you have made.
